==========================

If you want to implement Java in a XPages application, this hands-on workshop will show you the way. Hosted by two long-time Notes/Domino/XPages developers, you will build and deploy a simple, Java-bsaed XPages application on your own laptop. No Java experience necessary! Best of all, your code can be re-used in many of your own XPages projects. Come to this workshop and hit the trail to advanced XPages development. Note: Domino Designer 8.5.3 or above is needed to participate, but all are invited to attend.
